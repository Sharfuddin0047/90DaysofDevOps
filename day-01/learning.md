# 📘 DevOps 90-Day Learning Plan  

**Name:** Sharfuddin
**Goal:** Become a job-ready Junior DevOps Engineer  
**Duration:** 90 Days  
**Start Date:** 05-02-2026 

---

## 🎯 Intent (Read This Daily)

I am committing the next 90 days to disciplined, focused learning in DevOps.  
I understand that DevOps is not easy, not quick, and not guaranteed — but **I choose consistency over comfort**.

I will:
- Study even when motivation is low  
- Build real projects, not just watch tutorials  
- Stop comparing myself to others  
- Measure progress weekly, not emotionally  

**I am not trying to be perfect. I am trying to be employable.**

---

## ⏱️ Daily Non-Negotiables

- ⏰ **Study Time:** Minimum 4–6 hours/day  
- 📵 **No distractions:** Phone away during study  
- 🧠 **Active learning:** Notes + practice, not passive watching  
- 🧪 **Hands-on daily:** Commands, configs, pipelines  

If I skip a day → I compensate the next day.  
**No zero days.**
